# Feb23_24

This lab is simple to describe but is not completely straightforward.

In this lab you need to look at this week's Tutorial source file (the .Rmd file) and figure out how to make the two regression residual plots using `ggplot2`. 

Then you need to revisit the part of last week's lab that analyzed regression data. For this week you should practice making the two residual plots for each dataset. It might be hard to interpret the plots in cases where the textbook data has a very small sample size, so don't worry about getting the "right" answer in those cases. 

Also, do question 11.57 from the textbook.
